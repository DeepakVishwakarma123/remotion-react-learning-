# üöÄ Remotion + React Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository for **Remotion** and **React**! This repository will document my exploration of **Remotion** (for video creation) and **React** (for building user interfaces) while building some exciting projects.

## üìö What is Remotion?

[Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) is a powerful framework for creating videos programmatically using React. It allows you to use React components to render and animate videos frame by frame. This is perfect for creating dynamic, custom videos and animations like promotional content, YouTube videos, and even personal projects.

### Key Features of Remotion:
- **Use React for Video Creation**: Build videos just like you build React apps.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Create time-based animations and transitions.
- **Video Composition**: Combine multiple components to build complex video compositions.

## üìö What is React?

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It makes it easy to create interactive UIs by breaking them down into small, reusable components. React is widely used for building single-page applications and mobile apps.

### Key Features of React:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Write components that are reusable and modular.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Describe what your UI should look like based on the current state.
- **Fast Rendering with Virtual DOM**: React efficiently updates and renders only the parts of the UI that have changed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface of our video components.
- **Remotion**: For rendering videos based on React components.
- **Vite**: Fast, next-generation bundler for modern web apps.
